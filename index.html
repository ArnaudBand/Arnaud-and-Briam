                    freeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a non-profit organization[3] that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, students progress to project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.[4]. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCodeCamp" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
                    First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.
                    Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
                    Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
                    Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP). <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.
                    In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, you'll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You'll also learn how add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.
                    Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                    Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.
                    In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.
                    You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface). <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    Until this point, you've only used JavaScript on the front end to add interactivity to a page, solve algorithm challenges, or build an SPA. But JavaScript can also be used on the back end, or server, to build entire web applications.
                    Today, one of the popular ways to build applications is through microservices, which are small, modular applications that work together to form a larger whole.
                    In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality.
                    In the Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to.
                    Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express concepts. You'll also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and connected clients. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                <p class="p-text">
                    Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.
                    In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/" class="link-to-their-website">Search more.</a>

                    With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.
                    With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.
                    You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python.
